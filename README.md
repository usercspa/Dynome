This is a Hackathon Project which is built in span of 24 hours.

Hackathons are a great place to collaborate with others and make awesome projects!

But when you are building a Hack with teammates from a different timezone, things might get a bit confusing. It is hard for international teams to collaborate as multiple timezones are involved.

We have developed a web-app that detects users' timezones by location and converts other detect timezones in chat or web page to users' timezone, and a simple scheduler to help users to find the best time to meet.
