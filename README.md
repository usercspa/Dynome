# TimeSync
This is an Hackathon Project which is built in span of 24 hours.

Hackathons are great place to collaborate with others and make awesome projects!

But when you are building an Hack with teammates from different timezone, things might get a bit confusing.
It is hard for international teams to collaborate as multiple timezones are involved. 

We have developed web-app that detect users' timezones by location and convert other detect timezones in chat or web page to users' timezone, and a simple scheduler to help users to find the best time to meet.
